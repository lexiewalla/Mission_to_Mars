# Mission_to_Mars
Module 10 Web Scraping, HTML, CSS


## Overview

In this module we created a web application using flask and web scraping techniques to pull the latest information from the astrogeology.usgs.gov website. We used beautiful soup and splinter to assist with the web scraping. Once the information was scraped from the website we stored the info into a NoSQL database, Mongo. We maniupualted the html file so that when it is ran it shows the latest news article from the website and the featured image. We added a Mars facts table and used CSS and bootstrap to customize the table and website. At the bottom of the site we have the four hemispheres of Mars displayed with each of their names as a title for each image. 

To create this website we used Python, Beautiful soup, Splinter, MongoDB and CSS Bootstrap.
